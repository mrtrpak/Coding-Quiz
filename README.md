# Coding-Quiz

## Description

As a coding bootcamp student I want to build a quiz app that will challenge my fellow peers and show the javascript knowledge I know and able to implement into the app.

## Application Guideline

In this app once the user clicks "start quiz" the quiz screen with questions and the possible choices will come up. At that point the timer will start and count down by 1 every second. 

Once a choice is clicked on there will be a prompt showing if that was correct or incorrect. If it was incorrect there will be a 15 second penalty deducted from the timer. Then the next question will show.

This will continue through all of the questions

Once the quiz has ended or the the timer has run out a screen will appear showing the score. The score is equal to the amount of seconds on the timer left. The user then can enter their initials and this will be saved to the local storage with the score.
